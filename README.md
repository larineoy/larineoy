# Hi! My name is Larine Ouyang ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a high school senior passionate about **AI** and **Computer Brain Interfaces**!

I love solving complex problems, whether it's through analyzing brainwave patterns to detect stress or composing music.

Iâ€™m especially fascinated by **AI for healthcare** applications, particularly **EEG-based models** and how they can be used for stress detection and emotion classification. My journey into **AI**, inspired by projects like **EEG-Processing-Lib**, has helped me explore how technology can support mental health and enhance human-computer interaction. I also enjoy experimenting with **audio processing** and exploring the intersection of **AI and music**.

### Here are a few of my projects~

- **[EEG-Processing-Lib](https://github.com/larineoy/EEG-Processing-Lib)**  
  A library designed to process EEG signals efficiently, focusing on detecting abnormalities and extracting meaningful insights from complex brainwave data.

- **[EmotionClassifier](https://github.com/larineoy/EmotionClassifier)**  
  Developed as part of the **BWSI CogWork 2024 program**, this AI model can identify emotions in speech audio, detect the speaker's gender, and classifies emotions into eight categories.

- **[Facial-Recognition-Project](https://github.com/larineoy/Facial-Recognition-Project)**  
  Also part of **BWSI CogWork 2024**, this project focuses on identifying and matching faces using facial recognition techniques to achieve accurate detection of people in images and group photos.

- **[SleepStages-Abnormal-SpikeProb-Analysis](https://github.com/larineoy/SleepStages-Abnormal-SpikeProb-Analysis)**  
  An analysis tool focused on studying sleep stages and detecting abnormal spikes in EEG data, contributing to a deeper understanding of sleep disorders.

- **[Spike Detection Visualization](https://github.com/larineoy/Spike_Detection_Visualization)**  
  This project visualizes spike detection in EEG data, aiming to make sense of brain activity and provide useful insights into neurological conditions.

- **[K-nearest-neighbors-classifier](https://github.com/larineoy/K-nearest-neighbors-classfier)**  
  A simple but effective classifier that uses the K-nearest neighbors algorithm for pattern recognition and prediction tasks, exploring fundamental machine learning techniques.
