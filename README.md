# Hi! My name is Larine Ouyang.

I'm a college freshman passionate about **AI** and **Brain Computer Interfaces**!

Over the past years, I've been exploring AI, delving into various neural networks and machine learning methods. I've also been working with audio processing and the intersection of AI and music, such as creating music with AI. Besides that, I've been exploring natural language processing, working with transformer-based models and retrieval augmented generation.

Lately, I've been focusing on Brain Computer Interfaces and the processing of brainwave signals such as EEG , including general analysis of EEG and using AI to identify patterns in EEG data, such as detecting emotional states or converting EEG signals to text.

### Here are a few of my projects:

- **[Graph-Enhanced-EEG-to-Text-Generation](https://github.com/larineoy/Graph-Enhanced-EEG-to-Text-Generation)**  
  This project explores EEG-to-text generation using graph-enhanced deep learning architectures. It incorporates spatial electrode relationships and functional connectivity through graph-based representations to improve the text decoding from EEG signals.
  
- **[RAG-Indexing-Analysis](https://github.com/larineoy/EEG-Processing-Lib)**  
  This is an analysis framework for evaluating indexing strategies in a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. It compares different indexing methods (tree vs non-tree) and compares their retrieval accuracy and downstream LLM performance to identify optimal configurations to be used for a real-world text corpus.
  
- **[EEG-Processing-Lib](https://github.com/larineoy/EEG-Processing-Lib)**  
  This is a library designed to process EEG signals, focusing on spectral analysis (e.g. bandpower extraction) and spike detection as well as the loading and visualizing of EEG datas.

- **[EmotionClassifier](https://github.com/larineoy/EmotionClassifier)**  
  Developed as part of the **BWSI CogWork 2024 program**, this is an AI model that identifies emotions in speech audio, detects the speaker's gender, and classifies emotions into eight categories.

- **[Facial-Recognition-Project](https://github.com/larineoy/Facial-Recognition-Project)**  
  Developed as a part of **BWSI CogWork 2024 program**, this project focuses on identifying and matching faces using facial recognition techniques to achieve accurate detection of people in images and group photos.

- **[K-nearest-neighbors-classifier](https://github.com/larineoy/K-nearest-neighbors-classfier)**  
  A simple but effective classifier that uses the K-nearest neighbors algorithm for pattern recognition and prediction tasks.
